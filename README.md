# ClubLocker Demo

This is a small static demo site inspired by clublocker.com. It includes a homepage, product detail page, and a cart that stores items in `localStorage`.

Quick start:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local static server).
2. Browse products, view details, and add items to the cart.

Files added:
- index.html — Homepage
- styles.css — Styling
- app.js — Client JS (loads `products.json`, cart behavior)
- products.json — Sample product data
- product.html — Product detail
- cart.html — Cart page

Next steps (optional):

- Add real images and product descriptions
- Integrate payments (Stripe/PayPal)
- Build a backend for inventory and orders
